    "\n",
    "The computer science research group at UBC (led by Frank Woods), set up a Minecraft server and created datasets that describe how people play video games. To help target recruitment efforts, our group has used their dataset to answer the question \"which \"kinds\" of players are most likely to contribute a large amount of data so they can target those players in recruiting.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group examined whether a players characteristics, specficially age, are predictive of how many total hours they play. This represents how much data they contribute to the study, as being able to predict which players will generate more data can help the research team recruit new players effectively and create clear and more precise stratigies to pick new players up.\n",
